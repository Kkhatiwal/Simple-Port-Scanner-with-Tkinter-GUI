# Simple-Port-Scanner-with-Tkinter-GUI
This project is a basic network port scanner built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to input a target IP address and a range of ports to scan. The application checks which ports are open by attempting TCP connections and displays the results in a scrollable text area.
